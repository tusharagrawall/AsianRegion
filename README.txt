--Description--
This app is built yo show all the information about countries of all coontinents(regions), however now it just shows information for Asian Countries. The app uses Volley library and 
consumes the REST API. The app was also supposed to store the data in ROOM persistence library but because this application was built as an internship assignment, given a ddeadline of 2 days
it couldnt be implemented. But still it can work offline in many ways. As soon you press the 'START' button by writing a region, the app loads all the RESTful API data of ASIA region
(this is the reason the button click takes some time to transit to the next activity) and later all the data is loaded quickly without any delay. Only the image takes INTERNET usage to load,
otherwise the loaded data is saved .

Please give a feedback and contact if you want to collab.
